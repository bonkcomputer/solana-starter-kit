# Console Errors and Wallet Handling Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. React DOM Attribute Errors
**Problem**: Console errors about non-boolean attributes being passed to DOM elements:
- `Error: Received 'false' for a non-boolean attribute 'error'`
- `Error: Received 'true' for a non-boolean attribute 'centered'`

**Solution**: Fixed the Button component (`src/components/ui/button.tsx`) to properly handle custom props:
- Added proper handling of the `centered` prop by applying it as a CSS class (`justify-center`)
- Ensured custom props don't get passed to DOM elements by filtering them out
- The `error` prop issue was already resolved as it was commented out in the input component

### 2. Privy Authentication Error
**Problem**: `Error: User must be authenticated before creating a Privy wallet`

**Solution**: Updated Privy configuration and wallet handling:
- Modified `src/components/provider/PrivyClientProvider.tsx`:
  - Set `requireUserPasswordOnCreate: false` for embedded wallets
  - Removed EVM connector configuration to focus on Solana-only
  - Added proper MFA configuration
- Enhanced `src/components/auth/hooks/use-current-wallet.ts`:
  - Added proper authentication state checking before wallet operations
  - Improved Solana wallet detection logic
  - Added loading states and profile integration
  - Fixed wallet address resolution for both external and embedded wallets

### 3. Wallet Address Display
**Solution**: Ensured consistent Solana address display throughout the app:
- Updated `useCurrentWallet` hook to prioritize Solana wallets
- Added fallback logic for different wallet types
- Integrated with profile system to show usernames when available
- Maintained Solana address as the primary identifier

## Key Changes Made

### 1. `src/components/ui/button.tsx`
- Fixed DOM attribute passing issues
- Properly handled `centered` prop functionality
- Prevented custom props from being passed to DOM elements

### 2. `src/components/provider/PrivyClientProvider.tsx`
- Optimized Privy configuration for Solana-only wallets
- Improved embedded wallet creation settings
- Removed unnecessary EVM configuration

### 3. `src/components/auth/hooks/use-current-wallet.ts`
- Complete rewrite to handle both external and embedded wallets
- Added proper authentication state management
- Integrated with profile system
- Added loading states and error handling
- Improved Solana wallet detection logic

## Testing Results

✅ **Console Errors**: All React DOM attribute errors have been resolved
✅ **Privy Authentication**: Login modal opens without errors
✅ **Wallet Detection**: Properly handles both external Solana wallets and Privy embedded wallets
✅ **Profile Creation**: Create profile flow works for authenticated users
✅ **Address Display**: Solana addresses are consistently displayed throughout the app

## Benefits

1. **Clean Console**: No more React DOM attribute warnings
2. **Better UX**: Smooth authentication flow for all wallet types
3. **Consistent Display**: Solana addresses shown consistently across the app
4. **Proper Error Handling**: Better error states and loading indicators
5. **Future-Proof**: Code structure supports both current and future wallet types

## Next Steps

The application now properly handles:
- External Solana wallet connections (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)
- Privy embedded wallets for email/social login users
- Profile creation and management
- Consistent wallet address display throughout the app

All console errors have been resolved and the authentication flow works smoothly for both wallet types.
