## Current Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
1. User logs in via Privy (email or external wallet)
2. For email users, Privy creates embedded Solana wallet automatically
3. External wallet users connect their existing Solana wallet
4. Authentication state persists app-wide using Privy's session management

### Profile System
1. After authentication, system checks for existing profile in local database
2. If no profile exists, CreateProfileContainer is shown
3. Profile creation syncs to both Tapestry (social features) and local Prisma DB (backup)
4. Profile dropdown shows once profile is created/found

### Portfolio System
1. Portfolio data fetched via server-side `/api/portfolio` endpoint
2. Real-time token prices from Jupiter Price API v2 (batch fetching for performance)
3. Token metadata and logos enhanced via Jupiter API
4. NFT data with detailed attributes and marketplace links
5. Total portfolio value calculated from live market prices

### Trading Integration
1. Real-time trading data via `/api/trades` endpoint
2. Enhanced swap detection processes both buy and sell transactions
3. Balanced representation of BCT and SSE trades
4. Auto-refresh every 15 seconds for live updates
5. Transaction details with proper token logos and amounts

### Data Flow
- **Primary**: Local Prisma database for user profiles
- **Social Features**: Tapestry API for follows, comments, likes
- **Portfolio Data**: Helius DAS API for assets, Jupiter for prices/metadata
- **Trading Data**: Helius transaction API for real-time trades
- **Backup**: Tapestry identity lookup if local profile not found
- **Graceful Degradation**: System works even if external APIs are unavailable
